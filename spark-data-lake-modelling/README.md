# Spark Data Lakes

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Prerequisites

- REMINDER: Do not include your AWS access keys in your code when sharing this project!

## Datasets Used

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

``` sh
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
`songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent`

### Dimension Tables

users - users in the app
`user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level`

songs - songs in music database
`song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration`

artists - artists in music database
`artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude`

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
`start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday`

## Project Template

To get started with the project, go to the workspace on the next page, where you'll find the project template. You can work on your project with a smaller dataset found in the workspace, and then move on to the bigger dataset on AWS.

Alternatively, you can download the template files in the Resources tab in the classroom and work on this project on your local computer.

The project template includes three files:
`emr_cloudformation.yaml` - This is a cloudformation template to launch emr cluster quickly on AWS.
`etl_local.ipynb` - This is a notebook to run on local sample data
`etl_emr.ipnyb` - This is a notebook to run on emr cluster with s3 data
`etl.py` reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
`dl.cfg` contains your AWS credentials
`README.md` provides discussion on your process and decisions

### Run

#### Locally

- Update input_location, output_location and packages in dl.cfg
- Run etl.py by ssh into master instance of emr cluster
  - `python3 etl.py`

#### AWS EMR

- Create a S3 bucket for parquet output files
- Update input_location, output_location and packages in dl.cfg
- Run etl.py by ssh into master instance of emr cluster
  - `python3 etl.py`

## Output

### Local Dataset

- Total rows loaded into songs dataframes were 71 and events dataframe were 8056
- There is only one matching record in songs and events data by matching song title and artist name.
- 71 unique song rows
- 71 unique artists rows
- 98 Unique userIds
- 8023 Unique Time records

### S3 Dataset

- Question : Loading songs data is slow .count() functions returns slowly ?
- songs dataset contains 14896 rows
- events dataset contains 8056 rows
- 14896 unique song rows
- 9553 unique artists rows
- 98 Unique userIds
- 8023 Unique Time records
- There is only 319 matching record in songs and events data by matching song title and artist name.
- 6820 Songplays record with left outer join

## Best Practices

- Good to infer schema or supply your schema if known before hand
- Cleaning the data
- Removing corrupt Records
